## ML4H 2021

ML4H 2021 invites submissions describing innovative machine learning research focused on relevant problems in health and biomedicine. Authors are invited to submit works that fit anywhere within the broad purview of Machine Learning for Health. Similar to the last two years, ML4H 2021 will both accept papers for publication in a formal proceedings, and accept traditional, non-archival extended abstract submissions.

<b>Date:</b> December 3rd or 4th [tentative] <br>
Virtual Conference, Anywhere, Earth, (Mars soon)
</p>
<p>In response to the growing ML4H community, for the first time, ML4H will be a separate symposium, rather than a NeurIPS workshop. This event represents a continuation of prior ML4H workshops (e.g. <a href=https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/Schedule?showEvent=6209>2016</a>, <a href=https://ml4health.github.io/2017/>2017</a>, <a href=https://ml4health.github.io/2018/>2018</a>, <a href=https://ml4health.github.io/2019/>2019</a>, <a href=https://ml4health.github.io/2020/>2020</a>) and will continue to be held in December shortly before NeurIPS. This will allow us to expand the reviewing timeline and introduce a formal author response and reviewer discussion period, which we hope will improve the reviewing experience.</p>
